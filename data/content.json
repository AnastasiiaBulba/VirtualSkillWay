Our design team starts with concept sketches and mood boards to establish the visual style and atmosphere of each underwater area. We then create detailed 3D models and implement realistic underwater physics interactions. Each environment goes through multiple iterations where we test gameplay flow, difficulty balance, and visual appeal. The deep trench environment took over three months to perfect, with countless adjustments to current patterns, marine life placement, and obstacle distribution. We also work closely with our physics team to ensure that each underwater area feels unique while maintaining consistent gameplay mechanics.",
